### Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp

I have recently completed the Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp at [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a highly-selective front-end web development course focused around three main paired-programming projects. Main stack: Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Concepts covered include web accessibility, asynchronous programming, TDD, DevOps, advanced CSS primitives and more.

I will soon start the [full-time programme](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/introduction/schedule/) which further develops skills in Node.js, Express.js, SQL, authentication, React and Next.js.

Looking for apprenticeship sponsor. Please email [home@markhanley.co.uk](mailto:home@markhanley.co.uk) if interested.
